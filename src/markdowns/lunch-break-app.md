## Reflections

Looking back the whole progress, here are some key takeaways:

- Start from simple. Make the application functional first.
- Review code often. Find ways to simplify your codes.
- Testing. Test your code early to make sure the code works correctly.
- Share with others. I shared this app with my friends during the development phase. Got some feedback like the design and navigation.
- Project-based learning motivates me to move forward with a clear picture in mind.
