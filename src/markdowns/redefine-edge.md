_A new park mediates two distinct typologies - a field and a lake, inspired by the environment. This project creates not only a new relationship between architecture and landscape but also a dialogue between human and nature._

## Site

As one of the social and environmental issues, Coastal Resilience is brought to architects attention. The project not only mediates between two distinct typologies close to the site â€“ a field and a lake, but also creates a dialogue to the factory across from the site. The project demonstrates both the relationships between typology and water and the connection between architectural form and structure.
