_I share my thoughts about self-teaching web development in this post. It will be updated based on my learning progress._

**UPDATE 01/04/2022:** Draft initial post skeleton.

## Intro

I have delved myself into web development for almost a year. I would like to share some lessons I learned along the way.

## MOOC

MOOC, Massive open online course, has been the main tool I implement during my study.

### Keep a log

## Find communities

Usually you can find online communities if you are enrolled in some online courses. I highly recommend those. You can find a lot like-minded people, who share the same goal and are willing to help.

Additionally, some communities post trivial questions frequently. It is a good time to test knowledge you learned from the course.

Also, Twitter is a good place to visit. I followed my instructors and community public account. And I get to know what are new trends and what technology has been updated. However, keep in mind: balance well with your study time and your social media time. Otherwise, it can easily chip away your time.

## Reading and listening

Books and podcasts are good supplement while learning web development. Though, I have to admit learning programing through reading books is hard and seems outdated. I find it helpful to sometimes switch the medium a bit. Mainly I choose product design topics as reading during my casual time.

Also, some theory books introduce how programming develops are a good choice.

I also recommend some podcasts to entertain your ears. A big advantage is to let your eyes away from the screen for a while.

## Practice, practice, practice
