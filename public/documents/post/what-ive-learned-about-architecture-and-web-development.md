_With a background in architecture and now web development, I have the chance of comparing these two different industries based on my own experiences. This post concludes my thoughts._

**UPDATE 01/04/2022:** Complete initial post narration.

## Intro

I devoted seven years in studying architectural design with a Bachelor and Master of Architecture degrees. While at graduate school, I worked as a Graphic Designer for the University of Virginia Athletics and a Research Assistant for Beta-field (Alterior Office). I have worked for a global architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm - SOM and an American commercial real estate company - WeWork.

I have assisted senior staff with all aspects of architecture, from schematic design to construction documents. I conceived and drafted iterations of renovations in CAD/Revit based on the architects' sketches.

## The school life

Usually, architecture students devote more time than others in school. Since we have our own classroom called Studio.

During studio time, we sketch a lot. Sketching is a way of thinking and it works well for showing your working process. There is no limit on ways of presenting your design ideas. It could be a "fancy" model, or as simple as a paper model. Most valuable lessons I learned about design are not from final/mid-term presentations but fragmented studio critics. So review the working process constantly matters. School is a place not only for study, but also to grow my future network.

## A fast-pace giant unicorn

It was challenging to work in a high-tech, new age unicorn (WeWork) as a recent graduate from a tranditional education background. I have to admit it opens a whole new world in front of me. And I feel there is so much potential with the skills I have learned outside architecture.

Though my title as architectural designer, technically, WeWork should not be considered as an architecture firm. They adopt a whole new approach driven by data. Rapidly updating design based on numbers makes it more meaningful and efficient. Also, It is important for designer to work with people from different backgrounds. Sometimes, it will crash different and unexpected spark.

Make good design a part of the business strategy appears crucial in reaching your clients in a memorable way and creating a better experience for your customers. There is no such thing called "comfort zone" for designers working for a fast-paced tech unicorn.

## International cooperation

Future seems to be settled if you find a position in an international cooperation as an architect. Seniors will tell those young newcomers to learn to be patient in company. Be patient and keep learning is the essence if you want to make a way out of architecture. Below are some hard lessons I learned:

1. Fulfill a comprehensive understanding of the design process from strategy phase to architecture design, to construction & development through practice.

2. Cross-disciplinary collaboration not only accelerates the work-flow but also brings so much fun.

3. The ability to craft a good design is not enough, one has to be able to "sell" the ideas to the team and stakeholders.

4. Communicate proactively with PM and understand project performance through financial metrics can avoid over-design and make the designer's life easier. A designer who can think business "wins".

## Transition into tech industry

"Howie is super creative, graphically articulate concepts beautifully, and is a lot of fun to work with." said my former supervisor also my mentor - Jason DeChambeau, who was Associate Director at SOM.

We worked on an interior project together. Jason was super supportive when we had the idea of creating virtual experiences using VR as a part of our presentation for the client. After a quick analysis, learning precedents, and several iterations with colleagues, it turned out quite well. I was thrilled with the client's positive reactions. This is just one of those examples when I gradually realize my true interest in design.

Though architecture projects take way more time than digital products, I am still fascinated by how those tech-side trends "intrude" into the traditional strategy phase for architecture. For example, Design Sprint highly affects the way how architects propose their concepts at the strategy phase. New artifacts and interfaces broaden architects' horizon of how to present projects more humanely.

Besides, architects start with analysis, which cares more about the large context than the user. Personally, understanding the context is crucial; but how to leverage the role as a user is one issue I care more about.

After a few years in architecture, I soon found myself needing a change and a desire to find a more creative outlet for myself.

## Web development

My interests in web development starts with product design. It appeals to me because it embodies many elements of architecture design including empathy, usability (function) & aesthetic (form), and understanding the context in different scales. Also, there's a tendency that the ability to think like a designer needs to be highly valued in the tech industry.

It is a challenge for me to identify and understand commons/differences between the two industries. But I believe the drawbacks I experienced in the past are those triggers, encouraging me to explore more outside architecture.

So, I decided to immerse myself, learning as efficiently as possible and working on side projects as many as I can.

## Skills in common

As I complete a couple of projects in web development, I gradually find some skills shared in common between architecture and web development.

### Design phase

You probably will argue why to include design phase.
For me, having a full grasp of product design is crucial for developers. It usually answers how and why we code that way and make our design system more intuitive and flexible.
