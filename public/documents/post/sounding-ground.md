## Design

A new park design for Emancipation Park in Charlottesville.

The site is developed as a new surface above the existing with access to both the lower levels of park along Market Street.

Walking along Market Street, the site lies behind an open cloister-like facade with a main entrance leading to programs, an entrance/exit to the park, and a preserved tree oriented rest area.

This new opening stretches up gentle slopes, which responds to topography and the site's surrounding buildings.
