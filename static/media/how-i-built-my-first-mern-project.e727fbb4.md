_This post documents how I built my first MERN project - Snap App. It is a photo sharing platform for people who love architecture. It will focus on the general process and key concepts._

**UPDATE 01/06/2022:** Draft initial post skeleton.

## Background

When I am working as an architectural designer, I have heard many times people complain about not knowing where is the architecture in the photo was located. Since then, I had an idea of creating a platform for a bunch of people to share photos of architecture.

After delving into web development for a while, I finally get to learn necessary technologies and really start to work on my first fullstack project.
